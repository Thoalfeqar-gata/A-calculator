# A-calculator
This project really showed me how real programming is. You code a little, then you have to refactor a ton and fix bugs, then repeat.

I learned the following:
1- I learned to really value planning and coming up with a strategy before writing any line of code.

2- I learned a little about regular expressions in Javascript.

3- I learned/had fun coming up with decisions about how I want the calculator to function and look like.
